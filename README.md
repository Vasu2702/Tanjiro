# Video-player-with-notes
Imports:

We import necessary modules and components from React and external libraries.
React modules like useState, useEffect, and useRef are used for managing state, side effects, and creating references respectively.
ReactPlayer is used for rendering YouTube videos.
ReactQuill is utilized for creating a rich text editor.

Custom Toolbar Component:

CustomToolbar is a functional component that renders a toolbar for the rich text editor (ReactQuill).
It provides options for text formatting such as color, background color, bold, italic, underline, and strike-through.

App Component:

App is the main component responsible for the entire application.
It holds state variables like videoID, notes, editorContent, isEditorOpen, and editIndex.
The playerRef is a reference to the ReactPlayer component, allowing us to control video playback programmatically.

Seconds to Minutes and Seconds Conversion Function:

secondsToMinutesAndSeconds is a utility function that converts total seconds into a human-readable format (MM:SS).

Use Effect Hook to Load Notes:

The useEffect hook is employed to load notes from the local storage when the component mounts.
It triggers whenever the videoID changes to fetch notes corresponding to the current video.

Add, Edit, and Delete Note Functions:

handleAddNote adds a new note with the current timestamp, content, and date to the notes list.
handleDeleteNote removes a note from the notes list based on the provided index.
handleEditNote sets the editor content to the content of the note being edited, allowing users to modify it.
saveEditedNote updates the content of the note being edited and saves it back to the notes list.

Update Video Function:

updateVideo is a function that updates the videoID state based on user input in the text input field.
Use Effect Hook to Fetch Video Title:

Another useEffect hook fetches the video title from the YouTube API when the videoID changes.
It sets the videoTitle state with the fetched title, ensuring that the video title is always up to date.
Rendering:

The return statement renders the JSX elements for the video player, input for the video ID, notes container, and editor.
It displays the video player, video title, notes list, and editor interface.
Buttons for adding, editing, and deleting notes are also included within the UI.

Quill Modules and Formats:

The modules and formats objects define the toolbar options and formats for the rich text editor (ReactQuill)
